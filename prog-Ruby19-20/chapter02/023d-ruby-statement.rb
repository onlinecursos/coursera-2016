# Ruby stament modifies are useful shortcut if the body of an if or while
# statement is just single expression. Simply write the expression, followeb by
# if o while and the condition. For example, here's a simple if statement:

if radiation> 3000
	puts "Dange, Will Robinson"
end

# Here it is again, rewritten using a statment modifier:

puts "Danger, Will Robinson" if radiation > 3000
