		<H1>:nth-of-type(n) &amp; :nth-last-of-type(n), 2n+1 en este ejemplo</H1>
		<p>As with the :nth-child(n) and :nth-last-child(n) pseudo-classes, the primary difference between the :nth-of-type(n) and :nth-last-of-type(n) pseudo-classes is that the :nth-of-type(n) pseudo-class counts elements from the beginning of the document tree and the :nth-last-of-type(n) pseudo-class counts elements from the end of the document tree.<br/>
		Using the :nth-last-of-type(n) pseudo-class we can write the p:nth-last-of-type(2n+1) selector which identifies every second paragraph from the end of a parent element starting with the last paragraph. Here the paragraphs on lines 4, 7, and 9 are selected.</p>
