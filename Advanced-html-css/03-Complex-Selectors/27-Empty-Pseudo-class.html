		<p>Looking at the code below, if a user would visit a page with the URI fragment identifier of #hello the section with that same ID attribute value would be stylized accordingly using the :target pseudo-class. If the URI fragment identifier changes, and matches the ID attribute value of another section, that new section may be stylized using the same selector and pseudo-class from before.</p>
