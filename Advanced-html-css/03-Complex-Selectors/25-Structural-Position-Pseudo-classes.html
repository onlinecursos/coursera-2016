		<H1>:nth-of-type(n) &amp; :nth-last-of-type(n), 3n en este ejemplo</H1>
		<p>The :nth-of-type(n) and :nth-last-of-type(n) pseudo-classes are very similar to that of the :nth-child(n) and :nth-last-child(n) pseudo-classes, however instead of counting every element within a parent the :nth-of-type(n) and :nth-last-of-type(n) pseudo-classes only count elements of their own type. For example, when counting paragraphs within an article, the :nth-of-type(n) and :nth-last-of-type(n) pseudo-classes will skip any headings, divisions, or miscellaneous elements that are not paragraphs, while the :nth-child(n) and :nth-last-child(n) would count every element, no matter it’s type, only selecting the ones that match the element within the stated selector. Additionally, all of the same expression possibilities used within the :nth-child(n) and :nth-last-child(n) pseudo-classes are also available within the :nth-of-type(n) and :nth-last-of-type(n) pseudo-classes.</p>
		<p>Using the :nth-of-type(n) pseudo-class within the p:nth-of-type(3n) selector we are able to identify every third paragraph within a parent, regardless of other sibling elements within the parent. Here the paragraphs on lines 5 and 9 are selected.</p>
		<article>
		  <h1>Título 1</h1>
		  <p>This paragraph won't be selected</p>
		  <p>This paragraph won't be selected</p>
		  <p>This paragraph will be selected</p>
		  <h2>Título 2</h2>
		  <p>This paragraph won't be selected</p>
		  <p>This paragraph won't be selected</p>
		  <p>This paragraph will be selected</p>
		  <p>This paragraph won't be selected</p>
		</article>
